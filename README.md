# react-typescript-flight-indicators

> A React + Typescript porting of react-flight-indicators (https://github.com/skyhop/react-flight-indicators)

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-typescript-flight-indicators.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typescript-flight-indicators) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)


The `react-typescript-flight-indicators` package allows you to display high quality flight indicators using html, css3, React, TypeScript and SVG images.
The methods make customization and real-time implementation really easy.
Further, since all the images are vector svg, you can resize the indicators to your application without any quality loss!

Currently supported indicators are :

* Attitude (artificial horizon)
* Heading 
* Vertical speed
* Air speed
* Altimeter
* variometer

`react-typescript-flight-indicators` is a porting from [skyhop/react-flight-indicators](https://github.com/skyhop/react-flight-indicators), and refactored for use with React and TypeScript.

## Install

Using YARN:

```bash
yarn add react-typescript-flight-indicators
```

Alternatively, with NPM:

```bash
npm install --save react-typescript-flight-indicators
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import {
  Airspeed,
  Altimeter,
  AttitudeIndicator,
  HeadingIndicator,
  TurnCoordinator,
  Variometer
} from 'react-typescript-flight-indicators'

const Example = () => {
  	return (
	  	<>
			<HeadingIndicator heading={Math.random() * 360} showBox={false} />
			<hr />
			<Airspeed speed={Math.random() * 160} showBox={false} />
			<hr />
			<Altimeter altitude={Math.random() * 28000} showBox={false} />
			<hr />
			<AttitudeIndicator roll={(Math.random() - 0.5) * 120} pitch={(Math.random() - 0.5) * 40} showBox={false} />
			<hr />
			<TurnCoordinator turn={(Math.random() - 0.5) * 120} showBox={false} />
			<hr />
			<Variometer vario={(Math.random() - 0.5) * 4000} showBox={false} />
	  	</>
  	)
}
```

## Build

Using YARN:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

or:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Note:** to publish on NPM:

```bash
npm publish
```

## TODOs

Here's a list of missing features:

- General:	set custom scales (min/max values, ticks, limits of yellow/green arcs, ...)
- TurnCoordinator: currently, the slip-skid indicator ball is fixed; a property should be added to edit its position.
- ...

Example & Demo
-------------------

The JQuery demo can be found here : [http://sebmatton.github.io/flightindicators/](http://sebmatton.github.io/flightindicators/)

Here are a few examples of currently implemented indicators :

The image below shows a part of an 800px indicator. Vector images allows you to keep high quality render with large indicators.

-----------

Originally this project has been based on work by igneosaur, which could be found [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/igneosaur/attitude-indicator).

Further work is done by Sébastien Matton (seb_matton@hotmail.com), who developed the jQuery plugin as part of his master's for showing realtime flight information from a quadcopter.

[Corstian Boerman](https://corstianboerman.com) has adapted the project by Sébastien for use with React.

## Development log

### Created typescript react project 

Initial project created with the following command:
